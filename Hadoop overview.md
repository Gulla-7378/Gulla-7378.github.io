Q: What is Hadoop?
A: Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large volumes of data across clusters of computers.

Q: What are the key components of Hadoop?
A: Hadoop consists of two main components: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for distributed storage and Hadoop MapReduce for distributed processing.

Q: What is HDFS?
A: HDFS is the Hadoop Distributed File System, which is a distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster.

Q: What is MapReduce?
A: MapReduce is a programming model and computational framework in Hadoop for processing large data sets in parallel across a distributed cluster.

Q: What are the advantages of using Hadoop?
A: Hadoop offers advantages such as scalability to handle large datasets, fault tolerance to handle hardware failures, cost-effectiveness by using commodity hardware, and flexibility to process various types of data.

Q: What programming languages can be used with Hadoop?
A: Hadoop supports programming languages such as Java, Python, and Scala. Additionally, various higher-level tools and frameworks provide interfaces for programming in other languages.

Q: Can Hadoop process both structured and unstructured data?
A: Yes, Hadoop is designed to handle both structured data (e.g., databases, spreadsheets) and unstructured data (e.g., text documents, images, logs).

Q: How does Hadoop ensure fault tolerance?
A: Hadoop achieves fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes in the cluster. If a node fails, the data can be retrieved from other replicas.

Q: Is Hadoop only suitable for batch processing?
A: While Hadoop's initial focus was on batch processing, it has evolved to support near real-time processing through frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

Q: Can Hadoop integrate with other big data tools and platforms?
A: Yes, Hadoop has a rich ecosystem of tools and technologies that can integrate with various data sources, data warehouses, databases, and analytics frameworks.

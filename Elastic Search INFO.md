 Q: What is Elasticsearch?

A: Elasticsearch is an open-source distributed search and analytics engine. It is designed to store, search, and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in real-time.



Q: What are the key features of Elasticsearch?

A: Elasticsearch offers features such as full-text search, distributed architecture, scalability, near real-time indexing, support for geolocation data, built-in analytics, and a RESTful API.



Q: How does Elasticsearch store and index data?

A: Elasticsearch stores data in a distributed manner across multiple nodes in a cluster. It indexes data using inverted indices, which enable efficient full-text searching.



Q: Can Elasticsearch handle structured and unstructured data?

A: Yes, Elasticsearch can handle both structured and unstructured data. It can index and search data in various formats, including JSON, text, numeric, and geospatial data.



Q: What query capabilities does Elasticsearch provide?

A: Elasticsearch provides a powerful query DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that allows users to construct complex queries for searching, filtering, aggregating, and sorting data.



Q: How does Elasticsearch handle scalability and high availability?

A: Elasticsearch uses a distributed architecture that allows for horizontal scaling. It automatically shards data across multiple nodes, providing scalability and fault tolerance.



Q: Can Elasticsearch be used for log analysis?

A: Yes, Elasticsearch is commonly used for log analysis. It can ingest and index log data, enabling fast searching, filtering, and analysis of logs from various sources.



Q: Does Elasticsearch support real-time data ingestion?

A: Yes, Elasticsearch supports real-time data ingestion. It can index and make data available for search almost instantly after it is ingested into the system.



Q: Can Elasticsearch perform aggregations on data?

A: Yes, Elasticsearch provides powerful aggregations that allow users to perform calculations, grouping, and statistical analysis on data. Aggregations can be used for metrics, histograms, date histograms, and more.



Q: Can Elasticsearch be integrated with other technologies?

A: Yes, Elasticsearch has a rich ecosystem and can be integrated with other technologies and tools. It can work with Logstash and Beats for data ingestion, Kibana for visualization, and other systems for data pipelines and processing.

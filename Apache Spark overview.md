Q: What is Apache Spark?
A: Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides a unified analytics engine for big data processing. It offers high-speed, in-memory data processing and supports a wide range of programming languages and data sources.

Q: What are the key features of Apache Spark?
A: Apache Spark offers features such as distributed data processing, fault tolerance, in-memory computing, support for multiple data formats, real-time streaming, machine learning capabilities, and integration with various data sources and tools.

Q: What programming languages can be used with Apache Spark?
A: Apache Spark supports multiple programming languages, including Scala, Java, Python, and R. It provides APIs and libraries in these languages to develop distributed data processing applications.

Q: What is the core abstraction in Apache Spark?
A: The core abstraction in Apache Spark is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). RDD represents an immutable, distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel across a cluster.

Q: How does Apache Spark enable faster data processing?
A: Apache Spark achieves faster data processing through its in-memory computing capabilities. It keeps data in memory and performs operations on the data in-memory, reducing disk I/O and improving performance.

Q: Can Apache Spark process streaming data?
A: Yes, Apache Spark provides a streaming module called Spark Streaming, which enables real-time processing and analysis of streaming data from various sources, such as Kafka, Flume, and HDFS.

Q: Does Apache Spark support machine learning?
A: Yes, Apache Spark provides a machine learning library called MLlib. It offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering.

Q: How does Apache Spark handle fault tolerance?
A: Apache Spark achieves fault tolerance by maintaining lineage information of RDDs, allowing it to recover lost data partitions by recomputing them in case of failures.

Q: Can Apache Spark integrate with other big data tools and platforms?
A: Yes, Apache Spark can integrate with various big data tools and platforms. It has connectors to popular data sources and frameworks like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache Hive, Apache Kafka, and more.

Q: What is the Spark ecosystem?
A: The Spark ecosystem consists of additional components and libraries that extend the functionality of Apache Spark. This includes Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, Spark MLlib (machine learning), and Spark GraphX (graph processing).

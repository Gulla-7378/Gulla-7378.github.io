Q: What is NSFR?

A: NSFR stands for Net Stable Funding Ratio. It is a regulatory measure that evaluates the stability of a bank's funding sources relative to the liquidity profile of its assets and activities.



Q: Why was NSFR introduced?

A: NSFR was introduced as part of the Basel III framework to address liquidity risk in the banking sector. It aims to ensure that banks maintain a stable funding structure over a longer time horizon.



Q: How does NSFR differ from the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?

A: While both NSFR and LCR are liquidity regulations under Basel III, they focus on different time horizons. LCR evaluates a bank's short-term liquidity needs (30 days), while NSFR assesses the stability of a bank's funding over a longer-term period (one year).



Q: What is the purpose of the NSFR requirement?

A: The purpose of the NSFR requirement is to promote the resilience of banks and reduce the risk of funding mismatches. It encourages banks to maintain a more stable funding profile by relying on more stable, longer-term funding sources.



Q: How is NSFR calculated?

A: NSFR is calculated by dividing a bank's available stable funding (ASF) by its required stable funding (RSF). ASF represents the portion of a bank's funding that is expected to be stable over a one-year time horizon, while RSF measures the stability of a bank's assets, derivatives, and off-balance sheet activities.



Q: What is considered stable funding for NSFR purposes?

A: Stable funding refers to funding sources that are expected to be reliable and less likely to experience significant withdrawals or disruptions over a one-year period. Examples include retail deposits, long-term wholesale funding, and certain types of regulatory capital.



Q: What are the consequences of breaching the NSFR requirement?

A: Breaching the NSFR requirement may have regulatory consequences for banks. Depending on the jurisdiction, banks may face penalties, increased scrutiny, or the need to implement corrective measures to bring their funding profiles in line with the regulatory standards.



Q: Is NSFR implemented globally?

A: Yes, NSFR is part of the Basel III framework, which is a global regulatory framework for banks. However, individual jurisdictions may implement it with some modifications to suit their specific banking systems and conditions.



Q: Are there any challenges or criticisms associated with NSFR?

A: Yes, there have been some challenges and criticisms associated with NSFR. Critics argue that the calculation of NSFR is complex and may not accurately capture the liquidity risks faced by banks. There are also concerns that NSFR could potentially reduce the availability of credit and increase funding costs for banks.



Q: How does NSFR contribute to financial stability?

A: NSFR aims to enhance the stability and resilience of the banking sector by encouraging banks to maintain a more stable funding structure. By promoting longer-term and stable funding sources, NSFR reduces the likelihood of funding shortfalls during times of stress, contributing to overall financial stability.
